# Macros Functionality
- [ ] String format function of some kind.

- [x] Tests for at least all chain functions.
- [x] Allow variables to be used in most places expecting arguments.
- [ ] Punctuation type.
- [x] DefaultArgs instead of default for arguments with default values.

- [ ] ~~Separate array expressions from `syn`, `quote` and `proc_macro2`~~
